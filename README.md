# MyNPC
MyNPC allows players to create their own NPCs on their plot with ease.
The plugin was previously developed for a citybuild server called "VaroxCraft.de". As the server was shut down early this year, i am releasing some stuff i made for free.

As it was originally designed for a german server all messages are in german. However, they can be changed in `de.liquiddev.mynpc.Texts.java`

## Permissions
- `mynpc.use` (if enabled in config)
- `mynpc.limit.<count>` - limit for npcs
- `mynpc.emote.<emote>` - permission for labymod emotes
- `mynpc.edit` - permission to edit NPC of other players

## Plot integrations
The plugin has integration for  Plotme, Plotsquared, Lands and PlaceholderAPI to check if a player can place an NPC at their location. You can disable this in the config.
